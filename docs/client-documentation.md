Goals of the software:

- To allow air traffic controllers to control the flow of planes at the airport efficiently.

- To provide airport managers with an overview of the planes at the airport to enable them to make more informed decisions.

- To allow airport managers to configure the airport's maximum capacity, providing flexibility and control over the number of planes
able to be at the airport at any one time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What problem is the software solving?

- The software has been designed to prevent congestion at the airport, allowing the efficient flow of planes in and out of the airport.

- The software helps prevent wasted resources by allowing air traffic controllers the ability to override airport capacity to suit
various events.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What benefits will the software bring to the client?

- Air traffic controllers can control the flow of planes landing at and taking off from the airport.

- Airport capacity can be increased or decreased as necessary to help allocate resources efficiently.

- Airport managers can easily get an overview of the planes at the airport to enable them to make better informed decisions.

What are the risks associated with the software?

- Unforseen bugs or errors can cause disruptions in the software, which can impact the flow of planes in and out of the airport,
causing delays or cancellations.

- System failures may lead to plane delays and cancellations.

- Unexpected high air traffic could cause challenges for the system, leading to performance issues and disruptions.

- The software may not be able to handle unexpected weather conditions that may affect the flow of airport traffic.

- Data breaches may lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

- User training will be required, which may cause challenges.
